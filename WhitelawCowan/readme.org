* OBSOLETE -- this is now in .tex file.
* Installation

This is an R package which should be installed from the command line.
It does however require an extra package to be installed, so first do:

$ R
> install.packages(c('fields'))

If that works okay, change into the top-level directory of the program

$ cd /path/to/koulakov
$ R CMD INSTALL WhitelawCowan

If this installs correctly, you should see the process end with:

* DONE (WhitelawCowan)

You can then test the package by doing the following to run an
example simulation without using the pipeline.

$ R
> require(WhitelawCowan)
> source(system.file('runme.R', package='WhitelawCowan'))
